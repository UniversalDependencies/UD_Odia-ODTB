# Summary

The Odia UD Treebank (ODTB) is a part of the Universal Dependency treebank project.

# Introduction

The Odia Universal Dependency Treebank (ODTB) project is a collaboration initiated by the below institute/university to develop the first Universal Dependency Treebank in Odia language suitable for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

The Odia UD Treebank (ODTB) consists of 436 sentences. The ODTB data contains syntactic annotation according to dependency-constituency schema, as well as morphological/POS tags and lemmas. In this data, XPOS is annotated according to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Part Of Speech (POS) tagset.

    abstract = "This paper presents the first publicly available treebank of Odia, a morphologically rich low resource Indian language. The treebank contains approx. 1082 tokens (100 sentences) in Odia were selected from {\textquotedblleft}Samantar{\textquotedblright}, the largest available parallel corpora collection for Indic languages. All the selected sentences are manually annotated following the {\textquotedblleft}Universal Dependency{\textquotedblright} guidelines. The morphological analysis of the Odia treebank was performed using machine learning techniques. The Odia annotated treebank will enrich the Odia language resource and will help in building language technology tools for cross-lingual learning and typological research. We also build a preliminary Odia parser using a machine learning approach. The accuracy of the parser is 86.6{\%} Tokenization, 64.1{\%} UPOS, 63.78{\%} XPOS, 42.04{\%} UAS and 21.34{\%} LAS. Finally, the paper briefly discusses the linguistic analysis of the Odia UD treebank."
